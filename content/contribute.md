# How to contribute

The contents of the Augmented Leadership Manifesto, i.e., the statement and the 12 principles, are not set in stone.\
Instead, they are an invitation for optimization. However, this optimization will be curated.\
We, the authors of the Manifesto, will carefully read the comments on your pull request.\
After review, your changed content will be transferred to the respective pages.\
Or not if we believe that they do not represent an improvement.\

But all this will be open for discussion.

* For feedback, we use GitHub issues.
* For proposals, we use GitHub pull requests.

## Feedback via Issue

In the top right, hit the GitHub icon to browse to the site's repository.

Hit Issues on the top left.

Hit the button "New issue" on the top right.

Fill out the title and leave a comment to address your issue.

Hit the button "Submit new issue."


## Propose change via Pull Request

In the top right, hit the GitHub icon to browse to the site's repository.

Sign in or Sign up.

Hit the Fork Button top right to create a new fork.

Select an owner.

Hit button *Create fork*

Now you have your own "fork" of the original repository. It is a full copy of it. Changes to your document do not affect the original repository directly. So don't fear that you will break anything. You can make small changes or more extensive changes. You can create one change or more. Again, you cannot destroy anything. You can revert changes or return to older versions if you have made a mistake.

When you are satisfied with your changes, you can offer your changes to the maintainers of the ALM. It may be the start of an exciting discussion. This bidirectional communication is done within a so-called pull request on GitHub. The pull request is a discussion thread connected to a suggested change. While discussing modifications to the proposed changes may occur. The improvements covered by the pull request will be merged and integrated into the official website as soon as the partners are satisfied with the result.


### Do modifications to your fork

Browse to folder *content* and then to the *statement.md* or the principle you want to modify.

Hit the *Pencil* button on the top right.

Modify the text as you like.

While writing, you can switch between the Edit and the preview tab.

When you are finished, then commit your changes by doing the following:

As a commit message, write a summary of what you have changed.

Leave the option "Commit directly to the main branch."

Hit the Button *Commit changes*.


### Open a pull request to start a discussion

When you think the changes in your repository are worth consideration, you open a pull request:

Ensure you are in your own fork (and not in the central repository).

Hit *Pull requests* in the menu bar.

Hit the Button *Create pull request*.

Adapt the *Title* line and fill out the description to name your changes. Explaining the "why," background and/or your motivation, and the reasoning behind the changes is vital. The "what" is unnecessary because we see it in the changes.

Hit the Button *Create pull request*.

Now your pull request is added to the list of pull-request. The maintainers are notified automatically to review your changes. You will find the feedback directly in the pull request. You may get an email based on notification settings in your GitHub account when the maintainers or any other GitHub users give feedback on your changes.
