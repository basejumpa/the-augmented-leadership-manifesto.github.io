# 4. Principle

## Facts, data, science before opinions

**Build on what is verifiably resilient. Because everything else is vague belief and opinion**

**What are the facts? Which data form the basis? How were data and facts determined? What is the science behind the data and facts?**

In the digital era, what counts are reliable values, i.e. valid figures. Opinions may be able to command a majority, but they are not yet reliable. In an age of growing complexity, opinions as a basis for governance lead more and more quickly to dead ends. Only facts, data and science can lead us out of dead ends. Therefore: Facts, data, science before opinions. And also interests.

People have opinions and pursue interests. Science flees from certain opinions and interests and takes facts and data with it. What remains is a desert of ignorance. Is this a problem? Yes, at all levels of social, political and economic interaction. Can this problem be solved? Sure. By prioritizing facts, data, science over opinions and interests. The more people agree on this, the more powerful and sustainable the change.

On a scale of 0 to 100 percent:

- How satisfied are customers with the product?
- How satisfied are the employees who develop and manufacture the product for the customer?
- How innovative is the company that manufactures the product?
- What is the probability that the product will be driven out of the market by a competitor's product?

Four questions that can be answered with facts, data and science. Facts and data preserved in a fact and data history to be available for reconciliation in the future - [metrics-based governance](https://rosho.world/en/leadership/governance-with-tebiki/).

The scale from 0 to 100 % is plausible and arbitrary at the same time. The size of the scale is not important. What is important is that a scale is chosen and used consistently.

**Is metrics-based governance the reality?**

Yes and no. Often, management takes note of facts and data and then makes a gut decision. This is opinion-based decision making. It worked in the industrial era. In the digital era, the complexity involved exceeds gut and opinion-based processing. Today, facts, data, science count. Opinions can be entertaining, but they are no longer purposeful.
