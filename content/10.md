**Reacting quickly to changing markets, seizing opportunities at high speed, acting innovatively - this can only be achieved if agility is scaled throughout the entire company, i.e. if the entire company acts as an [intelligent swarm](https://rosho.world/en/leadership/the-augmented-leadership-manifesto/).**

As an intelligent swarm, a company can continuously provide innovative, high-quality products and services and hold its own against the competition. This requires the active participation of the competence leads from the competence circles Development, Operations, Support, Security, Business, Legal, Compliance and more.

Achieving [business agility](https://rosho.world/en/safe/safe-advantages/) and scaling it across the enterprise requires a mindset shift. Every transformation starts in the mind. The assumption that you can solve today's challenges with yesterday's methods is a mistake.

**Scaling business agility across the enterprise requires knowledge and implementation of the remaining 11 principles of augmented leadership.**
