If a column is missing, the swarm cannot fly.

**Statement:**

We have learned that we cannot solve problems with the mindset that created them. When projects fail, the root cause is always wrong steering. In short: failure of steering. Failure in steering is the root cause of most things that go wrong in this world, on any scale. Whatever is driven against the wall - evasion was and is possible in principle. But it requires a new mindset: [Augmented Leadership](https://rosho.world/en/leadership/about-augmented-leadership/).

Augmented Leadership (AL) offers enriched control that provides an expanded view of growing complexity. AL principles and methods are the solution to the root of leadership problems. AL enriches human intelligence with AI, provides next level interaction, and activates intelligent swarm mode. AL can be used to lead organizations of all sizes to sustainable solutions.

**Expect nothing less than revolutionary theses!**
