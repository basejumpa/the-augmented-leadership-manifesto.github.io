## One agenda for all decisions: Purpose, Value, Reality, Energy

**With four values for orientation**

**Exactly: One agenda, not two, three or more. And four values. That's it. Keep it simple!**

But aren't four values too few? And in the over-complex world, don't we need several agendas - depending on the situation?

Quite clearly: No! This whispering of the bureaucracy - "We need more and more and for everything the corresponding agenda" - is nonsense. And grossly negligent, because it answers entropy with even more entropy. In short: chaos to the power of two. Therefore: [An agenda](https://rosho.world/en/leadership/governance-with-tebiki/) with the generally valid values 'Purpose', 'Value', 'Reality', 'Energy'.

**Purpose:** What for? For what? Where should the journey go - and sustainably? In other words, not at the expense of other journeys, other projects. No matter what the project is, the purpose must be clearly defined, otherwise the result is a dead end or an even more costly mistake. This applies to everything, without exception, that has not yet been done but is planned.

**Value:** The values and qualities on which a person, a group, a company, an organization is founded and on which the planned enterprise is to be carried out.

**Reality:** The circumstances, i.e. dependencies, obstacles, existing risks, which can realistically be expected and which must therefore be strategically included for the planned enterprise.

**Energy:** What has to be invested in order to start and carry out the planned enterprise and to conclude it with sustainable success. Time, people, money - in essence, energy.

For decision-making based on the four values, mathematization and history are required. So that lessons can be learned from present decisions for future ones. Principle 1 of the AL Manifesto rocks all the more.
