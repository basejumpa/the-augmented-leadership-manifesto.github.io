# 5. Principle

## Visions before strategies or solutions

**First the vision, then the strategy, then the solution**

**Any other order is wrong and probably a costly mistake.**

Suppose you want to cross a river. One strategy would be to plan and build a bridge across the river, and one solution would be to build a bridge. But is this solution the only one? Let the team surprise you and work out parallel options!

Like swimming through it, looking for a ford, building a raft? Flying over it in a helicopter? Let more efficient strategies for solving the problem faster emerge from the [swarm](https://rosho.world/en/leadership/about-augmented-leadership/) and try several of them in parallel. Until the ideal solution emerges. And don't say we don't have time for creativity....

This principle applies to all companies and ventures without exception.

First the vision for a project, then options for possible strategies for feasible solutions. Starting with a search for a strategy, or even a solution right away, narrows the range of options. In this age of rapidly increasing complexity, weighing and evaluating options to choose the best one is critical. The second best may still be good, but the very best is critical for sustainable success.
