# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

You are invited to give feedback or even propose changes to the Augmented Leadership Manifesto.

- For feedback we use GitHub issues.
- For proposals we use GitHub pull-requests.


## Give Feedback via Issue

Browse to http://augmentedleadershipmanifesto.com

Browse to some principle of your choice.

Read statement and principles.

You doubt something and think it is some issue.

Scroll up.

In the top right hit the GitHub icon to browse to the site's repository.

Hit Issues on top left.

Hit button "New issue" on the top right.

Fill out title and leave a comment to address your issue.

Hit button "Submit new issue".


## Propose change via Pull-Request

Browse to http://augmentedleadershipmanifesto.com

In the top right hit the GitHub icon to browse to the site's repository.

Sign in or Sign up.

Hit the Fork Button top right to create a new fork.

Select an owner.

Hit button *Create fork*

Now you have your own "fork" of the original repository. It is a full copy of it. Changes to your copy do not affect the original repository directly. So don't fear that you break anything. You can do small changes, or larger changes. You can do one change or more. Again, you cannot destroy anything. If you have done a mistake, you can revert changes or go back to older versions.

When you are satisfied with your changes you can offer your changes to the maintainers of the ALM. It may be the start of an interesting discussion. This bidirectional communication is done within a so called pull-request on GitHub. The pull-request is a discussion thread connected to a suggested change. While discussing modifications to the suggested changes may occur. As soon as the partners are satisfied with the result the changes of the pull-request will be merged and integrated to the official website.


### Do modifications to your own fork

Browse to folder *content* and then to the *statement.md* or the principle you want to modify.

Hit the *Pencil* button on the top right.

Modify the text as you like.

While writing you can switch between the Edit and the preview tab.

When your are finished then commit your changes by doing the following:

As commit message write short summary of what you have changed.

Leave option "Commit directly to main branch".

Hit button *Commit changes*.


### Open pull-request to start discussion

When you think your changes in your repository are worth consideration you open a pull-request:

Make sure that you are in your own fork (and not in the central repository).

Hit *Pull requests* in the menu bar.

Hit button *Create pull request*.

Adapt the *Title* line and fill out the description to name your changes. Here it is more important that you explain the "why", background and/or your motivation, the reasoning. behind the changes. The "what" is not necessary because we see it in the changes.

Hit button *Create pull request*.

Now your pull-request is added to the list of pull-request. The maintainers are notified automatically to review your changes. You will find the feedback directly in the pull-request. Based on notification settings in your own GitHub account you may get an email when the maintainers or any other GitHub users give feedback to your changes.
